# <center>AICAT - A top-level Web3 virtual pet project created to bring the next 1 billion people into the blockchain</center>

## Background

Since the birth of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has gradually become a hot topic worldwide, and has also received widespread attention and application from various industries. The emergence of blockchain technology has broken the limitations of traditional finance and asset trading, making digital assets and virtual economies possible. The rise of virtual pets is a very popular category in the digital asset market, and it has become a major highlight in the digital asset market.

In urban life, people's spiritual needs are increasingly valued, so virtual pets as a way of spiritual comfort have gradually become popular. Different from traditional pets, virtual pets can accompany people in the digital world, bring them joy and companionship, and also have scarcity and collection value.

In this context, the birth of the AICAT project aims to bring more fresh and unique elements to the digital asset market, providing users with a brand new and interesting digital asset experience through virtual cat farming. At the same time, the AICAT project will be based on blockchain technology to achieve decentralization and value assurance of digital assets, providing users with a safer and more reliable digital asset trading environment.
